          OSR is an acronym, and as much as much as I would like it to also stand for some cool development terminology, it doesn’t. OSR is a place and more specifically, it’s a road. <br>
          Texas history digression: This road was used as early as 1691 as a major thorough fare from Mexico to East Texas. Feel free to Google on your own time, but it played a crucial role in Texas and American history. <br>
          Arguably, more importantly, it played a huge role in my own personal history. Along this really important road, there is a small ranch {Any visions about a really cool Texas ranch with lots of horses to ride and rivers to swim in - toss them. Picture more flat never-ending pastures, a lot of cows and some chickens} My grandparents purchased this ranch when I was young and around the age of 7, convinced my siblings and I to work on said ranch. Every summer through high school, we worked from 6am-3pm doing extremely thrilling chores like painting miles of fence, mowing fields, fixing the fences, feeding cows, picking vegetables and cleaning out barns. <br>

          {I assure you that the point is coming} <br>

          All of those monotonous chores that seemed to have no purpose but to torture me, taught me probably the most valuable lesson that I could have ever learned: All of the hard work that you put into the seemingly small details will manifest in the end. There is no greater satisfaction than to see the work that we did 15+ years ago holding up against the elements and time. We worked hard to do our jobs right the first time and we made a pretty awesome business and family retreat.  <br>
          Choosing the name OSR was meant to signify the hard work and dedication that we’ll put into your project. Nothing that represents your company is too insignificant of a task to devote our full attention and care to detail. <br>
          <br>
          Renee Dudley, <br>
          Founder <br> 
          Front End Developer<br>

          P.S. – Yes, maybe you will get to come to the ranch, if you’re lucky.
